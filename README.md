## .zshrc
My personal .zshrc config. Pretty much a combination of others formed together to what suits me most.

## Instalation
- run `./configure.sh`
    - script will back up your old config incase you don't like it
- If fonts are funny looking, install the powerline fonts from https://github.com/powerline/fonts
